# Evaluating Different Regressors
* Find and deal with missing values
* Deal with categorical data if available
* Establish pipelines and transformers
* Establish functions to get mean absolute error and mean square error
* Using feature engineering to determine and utilize needed features
* The techniques to be used are : 
  * Linear Regression
  * Descision Tree Regression
  * Random Forest Regression
  * Gradient Boosting
  * Using Cross-Validation
* Visualizing the data and the predictions of the models
