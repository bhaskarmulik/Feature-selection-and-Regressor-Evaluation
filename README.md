## Data-Science-Using-Scikit-Learn

* This repository is made to showcase my skills with respect to manipulating and predicting states using scikit-learn library
* In this project, I showcase the following general skills :
   * Dataset inspection and analysis
   * Feature Engineering to select appropriate features for training models
   * Dealing with missing values in a dataset and appropriate handling
   * Dealing with categorical data along with numerical data
   * Establishing pipelines and transformers for streamlining the process of model creation
   * Comparison of various models and their predictive capabilities. The models used here are :
      * Linear Regression
      * Descision Tree Regression
      * Random Forest Regression
      * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost Library)
      * Cross-validating data
