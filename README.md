## Data-Science-Using-Scikit-Learn

1. This repository is made to showcase my skills with respect to manipulating and predicting states using scikit-learn library
2. In this project, I showcase the following general skills :
   a. Dataset inspection and analysis
   b. Feature Engineering to select appropriate features for training models
   c. Dealing with missing values in a dataset and appropriate handling
   d. Dealing with categorical data along with numerical data
   e. Establishing pipelines and transformers for streamlining the process of model creation
   f. Comparison of various models and their predictive capabilities. The models used here are :
       Linear Regression
       Descision Tree Regression
       Random Forest Regression
       Gradient Boosting (XGBoost Library)
       Cross-validating data
